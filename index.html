        <p class="lead mb-4">I have mainly focused on working with children in order to pursue a career in developmental psychology. I have worked at Project Think for the past three years at the Claremont Mckenna Colleges. Project Think is an enrichment program for children with ages varying from pre-k to eighth grade. This organization offered me  the opportunity to be in charge of the pre-k children, containing a diverse amount of attendees, leading me to the chance to work with those who suffer from autism and ADHD. I learned how to manage time and schedule meetings and events accordingly with time as well as learn how to eep track of a large amount of children at one time. This therefore allowed me to apply my prior knowledge to real life situations, where I was then able to learn the different reactions these children have to the world around them and how they find ways to cope with their breakdowns. Not only did this opportunity allow me to understand how diverse human interactions are based on each individual, but it also strengthened my strive to keep learning more about cognitive sciences. I am also part of a the emotion regulation psychology research lab at the University of California, Riverside. I have worked in the lab for half a year where I have had the experience to work with bilingual children and parents from the Centro de Ninos preschool. I have learned how to formulate interview protocols as well as conduct research interviews and analyze qualitative data. I have worked with different teaching programs for instructors sto better classrooms just as with the Hand and Hand project. I also volunteer at the Upland friends animal shelter on the weekends, where I care for the animals as well as manage the front desk where I keep records updated on excel. I also volunteer at Baldy View Elementary School as a student aid for a second grade classroom, not only do I help the children with their daily tasks such as math and writing but I also assist the teacher with creating worksheets, daily plans, and grading this homework and test. This volunteering experience has allowed me to get a full scope on how children interact with one another and had also allowed me to learn how to deal with problems that come up frequently with children. I occasionally volunteer at Uplandâ€™s Saint Josephâ€™s Catholic Church as a youth ministry leader were I plan events and give talks to teens asboyt my personal experiences in high school. I assist with the night programs they have and help set up and clean them up. As a youth leader Iâ€™ve gained knowledge on the common problems and stresses high school teens go through which gives me a view on a wide range of age groups since Project Think focuses more on younger children. With all my work and volunteer experience, I have had the opportunity work and learn from children form the ages of three to eighteen therefore allowing me to be experienced in the developmental psychology field.
